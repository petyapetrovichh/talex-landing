  **Design Movement**: Neo-Brutalism / High-Contrast Editorial
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Raw Authenticity**: Embrace the "unfinished" but polished look to reflect the creator economy's raw nature.
  2. **Content First**: Typography is the hero; images are secondary but impactful.
  3. **Directness**: No fluff, just bold statements and clear actions.
  4. **Structural Rigidity**: Grid lines are visible or implied strongly, creating a sense of solid foundation.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Black (#000000)**: The void, the canvas. Represents the unknown potential of new content.
  - **Neon Green (#00FF00)**: The signal, the growth. Represents the "pay off" and vitality.
  - **White (#FFFFFF)**: The clarity, the message.
  - **Intent**: High contrast to demand attention. Green is used sparingly but surgically to guide the eye to value (money/growth).

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Asymmetric Grid**: Split screens that aren't 50/50. Maybe 60/40 or 70/30 to create tension.
  - **Sticky Elements**: Sidebars or headers that stick while content scrolls, mimicking a dashboard or reading app.
  - **Visible Borders**: Thin, sharp lines separating sections, reminiscent of newspaper columns or financial reports.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Marquee Text**: Scrolling text for "Live Ideas" or community updates.
  - **Monospace Accents**: Use a monospace font for data points (reads, tips) to emphasize the "economy" aspect.
  - **Oversized Buttons**: Buttons that span full width or have sharp corners, demanding a click.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Snap Scroll**: Sections snap into place to give a "presentation" feel.
  - **Hover Reveals**: Images or extra info appear only when hovering over text, keeping the initial view clean.

  **Animation**:
  - **Glitch/Reveal**: Text reveals with a slight digital glitch or typing effect.
  - **Parallax**: Images move at different speeds than text to create depth without shadows.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: 'Space Grotesk' or 'Syne' - wide, bold, quirky sans-serif.
  - **Body**: 'Inter' or 'DM Sans' - clean, readable.
  - **Data/Accents**: 'JetBrains Mono' or 'Roboto Mono' - technical, precise.

  **Design Movement**: Dark Mode Glassmorphism / Ethereal Tech
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Transparency**: Layers of content, implying depth and connection.
  2. **Glow & Light**: Content "shines" in the dark.
  3. **Fluidity**: Everything flows, nothing is rigid.
  4. **Immersion**: The user feels "inside" the platform.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Deep Void (#050505)**: Softer than pure black, easier on the eyes.
  - **Emerald Glow (#10B981)**: A softer, glowing green rather than harsh neon.
  - **Glass White (rgba(255,255,255,0.1))**: For cards and overlays.
  - **Intent**: To make the platform feel premium, futuristic, and magical.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Floating Cards**: Content exists on cards that float above the background.
  - **Central Axis**: Content flows down a central line, branching out like a tree or network.
  - **Overlap**: Sections slightly overlap to encourage scrolling.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Blurred Backdrops**: Behind sticky headers or cards.
  - **Glowing Orbs**: Subtle green gradients in the background behind key elements.
  - **Thin Strokes**: 1px borders with gradients for cards.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Smooth Scroll**: Butter-smooth scrolling with inertia.
  - **Micro-interactions**: Buttons glow brighter on hover; cards lift slightly.

  **Animation**:
  - **Fade & Float**: Elements gently fade in and float up as you scroll.
  - **Pulse**: The "Start publishing" button has a subtle, rhythmic pulse.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: 'Plus Jakarta Sans' - geometric, modern, friendly.
  - **Body**: 'Satoshi' or 'General Sans' - clean, legible.

  **Design Movement**: Swiss Style / International Typographic Style (Dark Edition)
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Grid Systems**: Mathematical precision in layout.
  2. **Objective Photography**: Photos are used honestly, without heavy manipulation.
  3. **Typography as Image**: Type is the primary visual element.
  4. **Asymmetry**: Dynamic balance instead of centered symmetry.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Matte Black (#111111)**: Sophisticated, print-like background.
  - **Signal Green (#00E055)**: Used strictly for functional elements (buttons, links).
  - **Off-White (#F0F0F0)**: For text, slightly warmer than pure white.
  - **Intent**: To convey trust, stability, and professional quality.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Modular Grid**: A strict 12-column grid where elements span specific column counts (e.g., 4-4-4 or 3-9).
  - **White Space (Black Space)**: Massive amounts of negative space to frame content.
  - **Horizontal Rhythm**: Strong horizontal lines guiding the reading flow.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Big Type**: Massive H1s that take up 50% of the screen height.
  - **Rule Lines**: Horizontal lines separating every section.
  - **Indentation**: Text blocks indented to align with grid lines, not the edge.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Instant**: No lag, no fancy transitions. Things just appear.
  - **Systematic**: Hover states are consistent (e.g., underline appears).

  **Animation**:
  - **Minimal**: Only essential state changes. Maybe a simple color shift.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: 'Helvetica Now Display' or 'Neue Haas Grotesk' - the classic, refined.
  - **Body**: 'Helvetica Now Text' - perfect readability.
